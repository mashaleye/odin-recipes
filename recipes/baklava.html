    <p> <em>A delicious phyllo pastry popular in Middle Eastern countries. <br>
        Its supposed origins are Turkish, dating to the Byzantine Empire (or even further),<br> 
        though many cultures claim it for their own. Many Greek and Lebanese<br> 
        restaurants serve it, and it is now a featured dessert of several former Ottoman countries.<br> </p> </em>

    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>

    <ul><h3>Baklava</h3></ul>

        <ul>
            <li>1 pound chopped nuts (almonds, walnuts, or pistachios are best, or use<br> a combination of them)</li>
            <li>1 pound phyllo dough, thawed</li>
            <li>1 cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/3 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        </ul>

        <ul><h3>Syrup</h3></ul>

        <ul>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>Finely ground pistachios for garnish, optional</li>
        </ul>

    <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Thaw the dough:</strong><br>
            Thaw the phyllo dough according to manufacturer's directions (this may take overnight).</li>
          <li><strong>Preheat the oven and prep the pan:</strong><br>
            Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a 9x13-inch pan.</li>
          <li><strong>Make the filling, melt the butter, and prep the dough:</strong><br>
            In a food processor, pulse the nuts until they are finely chopped.<br> 
            Combine with the sugar, cinnamon, and cloves.
            In a separate bowl, melt the butter in the microwave.<br>
            Roll out the phyllo sheets and cut in half so the sheets will fit in the pan.</li>
          <li><strong>Assemble the first layer:</strong><br>
            Place a sheet of phyllo dough into the pan. Using a pastry brush, brush the <br>
            phyllo sheet with melted butter. Repeat 7 more times until it is 8 sheets thick, <br>
            each sheet being "painted" with the butter.</li>
          <li><strong>Add the filling and continue layering:</strong><br>
            Spoon on a thin layer of the nut mixture. Cover with two more sheets of phyllo, <br>
            brushing each one with butter. Continue to repeat the nut mixture and <br> 
            two buttered sheets of phyllo until the nut mixture is all used up. <br>
            The top layer should be 8 phyllo sheets thick, each sheet being individually buttered. <br>
            Do not worry if the sheets crinkle up a bit, it will just add more texture.</li>
          <li><strong>Score, then bake:</strong><br>
            Score into 24 equal sized squares using a sharp knife. <br>
            Bake at 350°F for 30 to 35 minutes or until lightly golden brown, and edges appear slightly crisp.</li>
          <li><strong>Make the syrup:</strong><br>
            While baking, make the syrup. Combine the cinnamon stick, sugar, <br>
            lemon juice, honey, and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, <br>
            then reduce to medium low heat and let simmer for 7 minutes and slightly thickened. <br>
            Remove the cinnamon stick and allow to cool.</li>
            <li><strong>Spoon the syrup over the hot bakalava:</strong><br>
              Spoon the cooled syrup over the hot baklava and let cool, uncovered, for at least 4 hours.<br>
              Garnish with some finely crushed pistachios of desired.</li>
        </ol>
