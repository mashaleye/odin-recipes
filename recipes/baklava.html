    <p> <em>A delicious phyllo pastry popular in Middle Eastern countries. <br>
        Its supposed origins are Turkish, dating to the Byzantine Empire (or even further),<br> 
        though many cultures claim it for their own. Many Greek and Lebanese<br> 
        restaurants serve it, and it is now a featured dessert of several former Ottoman countries.<br> </p> </em>
