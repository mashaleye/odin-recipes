          <li>Beat 2 eggs with cold water and add it to the flour mixture, mix until dough is formed. <br>
            Do not over mix! Wrap the dough with cling film and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
          <li><strong>Make the filling:</strong><br> 
            in a large pan heat oil. Add onion and saut√© for 5-6 minutes, <br>
            until translucent. Add diced carrots and cook for 3-4 minutes. Add the meat and cook, <br>
