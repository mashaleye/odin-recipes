        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>

        <ol>

       <li> Place chicken drumsticks in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. <br> 
        Add 1/2 onion, ginger, crushed bouillon cubes, garlic, curry powder, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, <br> 
        black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Mix well. Cook until chicken starts sticking to the bottom, <br> 
        about 5 minutes. Pour in water, mix, cover the pot, and bring to a gentle simmer; cook for 15 minutes. <br>
        Remove from heat.</li>

        <li> Transfer chicken to a baking dish using a slotted spoon. <br>
          Strain cooking liquid through a fine-mesh sieve. <br> 
          Reserve 1 1/2 cups liquid. Discard solids.</li>
        
        <li> Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        
        <li> Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer <br>
           pink in the middle and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. <br>
           An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        
        <li> Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-low <br>
           heat and cook 1/2 onion until soft and translucent but not browned, about 5 minutes. <br>
           Add tomato sauce; cook and stir until slightly thickened and infused into the oil, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        
        <li>Stir reserved chicken broth, coconut milk (optional), 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence,<br>
           salt, and pepper into the pot. Bring to a simmer; add rice. <br>
           Cook, stirring often, until rice is almost tender, 15 to 20 minutes. <br> 
           Add frozen vegetables and continue cooking until rice is tender and creamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
        
        <li>Heat 1/2 cup of canola oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat. <br>
          Add plantains and fry on both sides until golden and crispy, about 2 to 3 minutes per side. <br>
          Drain on paper towels. Garnish jollof rice with friend plantains and serve with chicken.</li>
